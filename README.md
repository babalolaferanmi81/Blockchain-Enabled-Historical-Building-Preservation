# Blockchain-Enabled Historical Building Preservation

## Overview

This innovative platform leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize historical building preservation by creating a transparent, immutable system for documenting, funding, and maintaining architecturally significant structures. By establishing a decentralized registry of historical buildings and their conditions, the system ensures that preservation efforts are properly documented, funded, and executed according to established historical standards.

The platform connects preservationists, property owners, government agencies, donors, and contractors in a trusted ecosystem where all preservation activities are permanently recorded, compliance is verifiable, and funding is transparently managed. This approach enhances accountability, streamlines preservation processes, and helps safeguard our architectural heritage for future generations.

## System Architecture

The system operates through four primary smart contracts:

1. **Structure Registration Contract**: Creates a permanent digital record of historically significant buildings
2. **Condition Assessment Contract**: Tracks building condition and preservation needs over time
3. **Restoration Funding Contract**: Manages grants, donations, and disbursements for preservation projects
4. **Compliance Verification Contract**: Ensures renovation work meets historical preservation standards

## Key Features

- **Immutable Building Registry**: Permanent, tamper-proof records of historical structures
- **Transparent Condition Tracking**: Ongoing documentation of building state and preservation needs
- **Secure Funding Management**: Transparent handling of grants and donations
- **Verifiable Compliance**: Ensures renovations adhere to historical standards
- **Decentralized Governance**: Community oversight of preservation decisions
- **Tokenized Patronage**: Enables fractional ownership and support for preservation
- **Automated Reporting**: Streamlined compliance reporting to authorities
- **Preservation Knowledge Base**: Accumulated expertise for restoration best practices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16.0+)
- Truffle Suite or Hardhat
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Access to target blockchain network (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
- IPFS client (for storing building documentation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/historical-building-preservation.git
   cd historical-building-preservation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your specific configuration
   ```

4. Compile smart contracts:
   ```
